    "\n",
    "Ans: Single-line comments: To add a comment that spans a single line, you can use the hash symbol (#). Anything after the # on the same line is considered a comment and is ignored by the interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-line comments: To add comments that span multiple lines, you can use triple quotes (''' or \"\"\") as delimiters. This is often referred to as a docstring and is commonly used to provide documentation for functions, classes, or modules\n"

    "2. In Python, variables are used to store data or values that can be referenced and manipulated throughout your code. A variable is essentially a named storage location in the computer's memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "To declare and assign a value to a variable in Python, you can use the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "variable_name = value\n",
    "Here, variable_name is the name you choose for the variable, and value is the data or value you want to store in the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's declare a variable named message and assign the string value \"Hello, Python!\" to it:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "message = \"Hello, Python!\"\n",
    "Now, the variable message holds the string \"Hello, Python!\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables in Python are dynamically typed, which means you don't need to explicitly declare their type. The type of the variable is automatically inferred based on the value assigned to it. For instance, in the previous example, message is inferred to be of type string because we assigned a string value to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also assign different values to a variable at different points in your code. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "print(x)  # Output: 10\n",
    "\n",
    "x = 20\n",
    "print(x)  # Output: 20\n",
    "In the above code, the variable x is assigned the value 10 initially and then reassigned the value 20 later. The output of the print statements reflects the current value of the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that variables in Python are case-sensitive. So, message, Message, and MESSAGE would be treated as different variables. Additionally, Python variable names must follow certain rules, such as starting with a letter or underscore and consisting of letters, digits, and underscores."
